This repository is for educational purposes only. The goal is to touch on microservice, cloud, scalability and cost-efficiency topics through the lens of MLOps.

Blog post describing this simple GCP pipeline example can be found [here](https://thediscomole.github.io/portfolio/machine-learning-pipeline/).
